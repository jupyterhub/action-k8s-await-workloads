# GitHub Action: Await k8s workloads

[![GitHub Action badge](https://github.com/jupyterhub/action-k8s-await-workloads/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jupyterhub/action-k8s-await-workloads/actions)

An action to help you await successful startup of Kubernetes workloads:
DaemonSets, Deployments, and StatefulSets.

- Await workloads in parallel.
- Reports time waited.
- Can abort on container restarts.
- Can abort on timeout.
- Can be complemented with
  [jupyterhub/action-k8s-namespace-report](https://github.com/jupyterhub/action-k8s-namespace-report)
  to provide `kubectl describe` / `kubectl logs` details of any chosen workloads
  or pods with issues.

## Optional input parameters

- `workloads`: Await a subset of the namespace's workloads. Example:
  `"deplpy/hub,sts/user-placeholder"`.
- `namespace` Await workloads within this namespace instead of the current
  contexts namespace.
- `timeout`: Aborts after this time in seconds. Defaults to `-1` which means
  infinite.
- `max-restarts`: Aborts after this many container restarts for any given
  container. Defaults to `-1` which means infinite.
